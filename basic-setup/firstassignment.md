**Install Homebrew on you laptop and install git**
I did this by going to the [homebrew page](http://brew.sh/) and entering the command line /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" in the command prompt. I don't really understand what homebrew does and what the benefits are though, it does _something_ better than Apple but I don't know what.

**Create an SSH key and add it to your github configuration** 
That was harder. First had to figure out what an SSH key is and does (still don't completely understand), went through [github tutorials](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).

**Clone this repository git@github.com:cgmv/greyhound.git - (needs your ssh key)**
Right, so going to your cgmv account I could find the repo, and then have the option to download it, or get it running on the Desktop version which you've said I shouldn't use. But what's the difference between "cloning a repository" and "forking it to my account"?

**Fork a random repo into your account**
Done, just searched for "repo" in repositories, found one about Kodi (I'm using that to watch movies at home) and now it shows up as one of my repos (the other being pdntspa)

**Document how you achieved this using markdown and add all the findings to you hibhub repo.**
